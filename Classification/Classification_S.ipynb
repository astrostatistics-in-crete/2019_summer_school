This is the process of attributing a \"**class**\" (or equivalently, a \"**label**\") to an object of an arbitrary type (e.g. a string or an image) in order to catalogue it based on its **properties** (the actual information that we pass to the machine, e.g. the pixel intensities in the case of an image).\n",

    "\n",
    "Classification can come in 2 major flavors, based on the type of intervention by the user:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unsupervised** | The classification is defined \"unsupervised\" when the user does not provide labels during the training process. In other words, the machine does not know a priori what a class is or what properties it should represent. On the contrary, it has to independently **learn the definition of each \"class\"** using the training data and only _then_ proceed to classify the actual data. For example we would like to distinguish two overlapping \"clouds\" in a scatter plot, and then classify future measurements based on which cloud they fall on. The user can assist the machine in splitting the training data into different classes by imposing the total number of classes, and by running the analysis using the properties which maximise the differences between objects. A classical application of unsupervised classification is represented by \"clustering\" analysis (see relevant session).\n",
    "\n",
    "    _In practice, the machine learns to cluster objects with similar properties._\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Supervised** | The classification is defined \"supervised\" when the user provides a label for each object in the training set. In this case, the idea is that we can train the model to associate the label with some given characteristics of the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    _In practice, the machine learns to find similarities between objects with the same label._\n",
